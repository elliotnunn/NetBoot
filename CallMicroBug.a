; A snippet that you can INCLUDE directly, to invoke MicroBug at early boot,
; when otherwise you would get a Sad Mac. Trick is to init the Event Queue.
; Expect 8 bytes of unfamiliar stuff on the stack and some clobbered regs.

; If you use this as a function, don't forget to RTS!

            move.w  #20,d0      ; number of events
            dc.w    $A06D       ; _InitEvents

            move.l  $2BA,-(SP)  ; save DSAlertTab
            move.l  #-1,$2BA    ; because it needs to be nonzero
            move.w  #13,d0      ; as if we called _Debugger while it was unimp
            dc.w    $A9C9       ; _SysError
            move.l  (SP)+,$2BA  ; restore DSAlertTab
